 [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and provide final answers.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\nI am solving a question:\n<question>\nHow many studio albums were published by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (included)? You can use the latest 2022 version of english wikipedia.\n</question>\n\nNow, I have solved the question by decomposing it into several subtasks, the subtask information is as follows:\n<subtask_info>\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.0: Search for Mercedes Sosa's Wikipedia page and extract the content of her discography section, focusing specifically on albums released between 2000 and 2009.\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.0 result: I encountered issues while trying to extract the discography section from Mercedes Sosa's Wikipedia page using both the extraction and browsing tools. The extraction tool returned an error, and the browsing tool also failed to retrieve the necessary information.\n\nAs a next step, I suggest manually visiting the Wikipedia page for Mercedes Sosa at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa) and checking the discography section for albums released between 2000 and 2009. This will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.1: If the Wikipedia page doesn't provide complete information, search the web for additional reliable sources about Mercedes Sosa's discography during 2000-2009.\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.1 result: \n\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.2: Compile a comprehensive list of Mercedes Sosa's studio albums released between 2000 and 2009, clearly distinguishing studio albums from other types of releases (compilations, live albums, etc.).\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.2 result: \n\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.3: Count the number of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive) and provide the final answer to the original question with supporting evidence.\nSubtask 8e867cd7-cff9-4e6c-867a-ff5ddc2550be.3 result: \n\n\n</subtask_info>\n\nNow, I need you to determine the final answer. Do not try to solve the question, just pay attention to ONLY the format in which the answer is presented. DO NOT CHANGE THE MEANING OF THE PRIMARY ANSWER.\nYou should first analyze the answer format required by the question and then output the final answer that meets the format requirements. \nHere are the requirements for the final answer:\n<requirements>\nThe final answer must be output exactly in the format specified by the question. The final answer should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nIf you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. Numbers do not need to be written as words, but as digits.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. In most times, the final string is as concise as possible (e.g. citation number -> citations)\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.\n</requirements>\n\nPlease output with the final answer according to the requirements without any other text. If the primary answer is already a final answer with the correct format, just output the primary answer.\n    "}]
